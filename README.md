# CareApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.

This project aims at developing a Web application to do Donations to poor or needy people.
Needy people can get registered through this application and donors also can register through this application.After  that donors can make donations by checking a list of needy people. This avoids going to banks to make donations and donation handling will be done through this platform.

As this is an ongoing project we need support from developers to develop this application.
Any sort of a contribution is appreciated. 
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
